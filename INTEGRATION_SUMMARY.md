##  UX Improvements Implemented

### Asset Selection Enhancement
**Problem:** Users had to manually type ticker symbols, which was error-prone and tedious.

**Solution:** Implemented smart dropdown menus across all pages:

1. **Multi-Select Dropdowns** (for multi-asset analysis):
   - Market Analysis page
   - Systemic Risk page
   - Market Regime page (tab 6)
   
2. **Single-Select Dropdowns** (for single-asset focus):
   - Trading Signals page
   - Liquidity page
   - Market Regime page (main ticker)

3. **Common Ticker List** (45 assets):
   ```python
   COMMON_TICKERS = [
       # Major ETFs
       "SPY", "QQQ", "IWM", "DIA", "TLT", "GLD", "SLV", "USO", "UUP",
       
       # Tech Giants
       "AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "AMZN", "NVDA", "META", "TSLA",
       
       # Blue Chips
       "BRK.B", "JPM", "V", "JNJ", "WMT", "PG", "MA", "HD", "DIS", "BAC", "XOM",
       
       # Tech & Semiconductors
       "NFLX", "ADBE", "CRM", "CSCO", "INTC", "AMD", "QCOM", "TXN",
       
       # Sector ETFs
       "XLF", "XLE", "XLK", "XLV", "XLY", "XLP", "XLI", "XLU", "XLB"
   ]
   ```

4. **Custom Ticker Input** - Always available as backup for any unlisted ticker
